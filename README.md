# **TagDraco : Simple MP3 metadata editing tool**
Version 1.2.18\
This simple tool was made for all people wanting to easily change their mp3 metadata.
Although Windows can do such a thing, it does not allow you to change the Album cover :)

Using TagLib-Sharp from https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp
